# Build and Publish NI PKGS into NI Package Manager Feeds

- An internal tool, known as `NI MEASUREMENT PLUGIN PACKAGE BUILDER`, was utilized for the
  construction of the packages.

## Create and Update NI Package Manager Feeds

- The NI Package Manager packages for different measurement plugins are added to an NI Package
  Manager feed. So the users can install new packages or receive updates on existing feeds by
  subscribing to the feed.

- The feeds for Measurement plugins are maintained under the attached repo
  [`package-manager-feeds`](https://github.com/NI-MeasurementLink-Plug-Ins/package-manager-feeds).

- Please follow the procedure mentioned in attached document for adding new packages or updating new
  versions of existing packages to the feed
  [`README.md`](https://github.com/NI-MeasurementLink-Plug-Ins/package-manager-feeds/blob/main/package-feed-updater/README.md).
